# GSLU - Game Save Linking Utility

This is a utility program that I originally made for myself to help create links for my game saves. The best use I see for it is linking the saves directory to a cloud service like OneDrive or a NAS, to be used for backup and for syncing with other computers.

**This program currently needs to be run as Administrator and is only working on Windows.**
